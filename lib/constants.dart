List <String> planetinfo=[
"Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, boasts a barren landscape marked by vast impact craters and smooth plains. Its atmosphere is nearly non-existent, leading to extreme temperature shifts between its scorching days and freezing nights.",
"Venus, shrouded by a thick toxic atmosphere, experiences a greenhouse effect that has driven its surface temperatures to extreme levels. The planet's rocky terrain showcases volcanic plains and highlands",
"Earth stands out as a unique oasis with its nurturing environment, abundant water, and diverse ecosystems. The planet's life-sustaining atmosphere harbors oxygen and a blend of gases that support a wide range of species, making it a haven for biodiversity.",
"Mars, often dubbed the'Red Planet,' displays a rust-hued surface marked by craters, canyons, and evidence of ancient riverbeds. Its thin atmosphere has hints of past liquid water, fueling speculation about the possibility of past or present microbial life.",
"Jupiter, a colossal gas giant, boasts a turbulent atmosphere with the iconic Great Red Spotâ€”a centuries-old storm. The planet's immense size and powerful magnetic field influence its numerous moons, some of which have showcased surprising geological activity.",
"Saturn's majestic rings are a defining feature, composed of countless ice and dust particles that encircle the gas giant. Beneath its ringed allure, Saturn is a gaseous world with a lower density than water, and it hosts an array of moons with diverse characteristics.",
"Uranus stands out for its axial tilt, rolling through space almost perpendicular to its orbit. This ice giant boasts a distinct blue-green hue due to methane in its atmosphere and possesses a unique ring system and assortment of icy moons.",
"Neptune, the outermost planet, showcases an exquisite deep-blue hue and extreme winds that traverse its stormy atmosphere. This ice giant's most significant moon, Triton, exhibits cryovolcanic activity and intriguing retrograde motion ",
